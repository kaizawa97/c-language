//On the afternoon/ of 29 April, Hitler learned that his ally, 
/*Benito Mussolini, had been executed by Italian partisans. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress,*/ 
Clara Petacci, had been strung up by their heels. The corpses were later cut down and thrown into the gutter, 
where they were mocked by Italian dissenters. 
These events may have strengthened Hitler's resolve not to allow himself or his wife to be made a "spectacle" of, 
as he had earlier recorded in his testament.
